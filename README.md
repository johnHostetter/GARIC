# Generalized Approximate Reasoning Intelligent Controller (GARIC)

This code is my early attempt at creating neuro-fuzzy networks following the approach outlined in:

H. R. Berenji and P. Khedkar, "Learning and tuning fuzzy logic controllers through reinforcements," in IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks, vol. 3, no. 5, pp. 724-740, Sept. 1992, doi: 10.1109/72.159061.

The code also contains other functions that attempted to create the neuro-fuzzy networks from data-driven techniques, such as my early attempts at Empirical Fuzzy Sets.

This repository is made publicly available for others to build on top of, but use with caution, as since this was my work from the beginning of my Ph.D., there may be mistakes as I was still learning about fuzzy logic at the time.
